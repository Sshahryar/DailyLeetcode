# Leetcode

Repository where I will be pushing my solutions for Leetcode daily challenges, contests, problems, and all things Leetcode. Starting September 23, 2023. 

Leetcode is a website that offers coding problems and challenges and enhancement of problem-solving skills and algorithms, including data structures. 

Below will be updates on the Daily Challenge Solutions**. Info on other folders in the repository such as courses, challenges, etc. can be found in the wiki. 

**The daily challenge updates are based on this title format: Solution (date) (language, leetcode ide) (name of challenge) (difficulty). 

**The daily challenge solutions are designed to work on the leetcode ide, and may or may not work on ide's outside of leetcode. 

## Leetcode Daily Challenge Solutions:

### Solution Sept 23 (Java, leetcode ide) 1048. LongestStrChain (Medium): 

#### Prompt:

You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

#### Solution:

    class Solution {
        public int longestStrChain(String[] words) {
            int ans = 0;
            Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a.length(), b.length()));
        
        Map<String, Integer> dp = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
        
        for (String w: words) {
            int best = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
                String prev = w.substring(0, i) + w.substring(i + 1);
                best = Math.max(best, dp.getOrDefault(prev, 0) + 1);
            }
            dp.put(w, best);
            ans = Math.max(ans, best);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    }

#### Application:

Dynamic programming, arrays, map, hashmap, e.t.c
    
### Solution Sept 25 (Java, leetcode ide) 389. Find the Difference (Easy):

#### Prompt:

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

#### Source code:

    public class Solution {
        public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
            int[] charCount = new int[26];
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCount[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            charCount[c - 'a']--;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (charCount[i] < 0) {
                return (char) (i + 'a');
            }
        }
        
        return ' ';
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String s = "abcd";
        String t = "abcde";
        char addedLetter = solution.findTheDifference(s, t);
        System.out.println("The added letter is: " + addedLetter);
    }
    }

#### Application:

Character arrays.
